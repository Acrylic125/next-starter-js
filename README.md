# NextJS Starter

This repository is a collection of NextJS starting templates with preconfigured libraries and frameworks.

## Getting Started

First, choose which template you wish to use. Then, follow the instructions in the README.md file in the template's folder.

## Why This?

A starter project helps to kickstart your next project. It provides a base to build on top of. This removes the need to reinstall and configure the same libraries and frameworks for every project that uses similar technologies.

There are many pre-existing ways to kickstart a NextJS project like the following:

- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples
- https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app

However, I wanted to create a template that is more opinionated to my needs, that has a more complete setup. These templates are meant to be another starting point that differs from pre-existing templates.
